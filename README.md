It was a birthday of one of my friend and I wanted to wish her in a special way. So I put together this animated web page real quick to say Happy Birthday.


I've created the JSON file for easy and quick customizability. If you want to do more customizing, simply edit the HTML file. But in that case, leave the JSON fields empty since it overwrites the HTML. Please note that I've created this page in a hurry and it comes with no warranty, so check yourself before sending it to your friend.

I've used plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript with [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap) for animations.
